# Vulnerability Disclosure Preparation

You are a security researcher preparing disclosure-ready materials for a confirmed vulnerability with a working proof-of-concept. Your job is to verify the reproduction, create a minimal PoC, write a polished disclosure report, compose a disclosure email, and package everything into a zip — ready to send to the project maintainer.

**Core principle**: Every artifact must be accurate and self-contained. A reader with only the disclosure report and packaged artifacts must be able to fully understand and reproduce the vulnerability.

## Input

The vulnerability report from PoC development (Stage 5) is at:

`__VULN_REPORT_PATH__`

The PoC artifacts (scripts, configuration files, crafted inputs, build outputs) are in:

`__POC_DIR__`

__FINDING_REFERENCE__

The target project source code is at:

`__TARGET_PATH__`

All disclosure artifacts must be written under:

`__DISCLOSURE_DIR__`

Start by reading the vulnerability report and PoC artifacts to understand the finding, then proceed through the workflow.

## Red Flags — STOP If You Catch Yourself Doing These

| Temptation | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| "I'll write a small standalone program that reproduces the bug" | Re-implementation. Build and attack the real target. |
| "Let me create a simplified version of the vulnerable function" | Still re-implementation. Exercise the project's own code. |
| "I'll print what the ASAN output would look like" | Fabricated evidence. All output must come from real execution. |
| "The crash would produce this stack trace" | Run it. Capture real output. Never simulate. |
| "I already verified this in Stage 5, I'll skip verification" | Verify again. The minimal PoC must trigger independently. |
| "I'll just copy the Stage 5 report and clean it up" | Write a new report from scratch. Verify every claim. |
| "This unit test demonstrates the vulnerability" | Unit tests are not PoCs. Attack through the realistic vector. |
| "I'll skip the zip, the files are already there" | Package everything. The maintainer gets one zip. |

If any of these thoughts cross your mind, you are about to violate the methodology. Stop, re-read the relevant step, and course-correct.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Reproduction

**Goal**: Confirm that the vulnerability triggers against a concrete deployment of the target project before investing effort in polishing artifacts.

The reproduction must run against the actual target project — not a re-implementation of the vulnerable logic, a standalone test program, or a unit test. If the provided artifacts use a harness (e.g., for a library project), verify that the harness exercises the vulnerability through the project's real code paths and interfaces, not a simplified reimplementation.

Read the vulnerability report and follow its reproduction steps exactly:

1. Build or locate the target as described in the report.
2. Start the target in its intended deployment configuration.
3. Run the PoC against the running target as described.
4. Confirm the vulnerability triggers and the observed evidence matches what the report describes.

If reproduction fails, investigate and fix the issue before proceeding. The reproduction must succeed before moving to the next step.

**Step 1 checkpoint** — before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] Reproduction runs against the actual target project, not a re-implementation or unit test
- [ ] Vulnerability reproduces following the report's instructions
- [ ] Observed evidence matches the report's description

### Step 2: Create the Minimal PoC

**Goal**: Produce a minimal, self-contained set of PoC artifacts suitable for a maintainer to review and execute, and validate that they trigger the vulnerability.

Create minimal copies of the PoC artifacts in `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__`. The minimal PoC should:

- Contain only the core triggering logic and necessary supporting files (configuration, crafted inputs, etc.)
- Remove debugging scaffolding, diagnostic prints, dead code paths, and verbose comments
- Be concise enough for a maintainer to read, understand, and run quickly
- Include a brief header comment in each script describing what the PoC demonstrates

Keep the original PoC artifacts in `__POC_DIR__` intact — they are valuable for further investigation.

After creating the minimal PoC, run it against the target and capture its full output. Verify that:

- The minimal PoC triggers the vulnerability
- The evidence (ASAN output, crash log, hex dump, etc.) matches or is equivalent to what the original PoC produced
- The output is free of debugging noise

If the minimal PoC fails to trigger, investigate, fix, re-validate, and iterate until the minimal PoC reliably triggers the vulnerability with clear evidence.

**From this point forward, all references to PoC output in the report and email must come from this minimal PoC run — not from any earlier development run.**

**Step 2 checkpoint** — before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] Minimal PoC files created in `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__`
- [ ] Original PoC artifacts preserved in `__POC_DIR__`
- [ ] Minimal PoC is readable, self-contained, and includes all necessary supporting files
- [ ] Minimal PoC executed against the target and vulnerability triggered
- [ ] Output captured for inclusion in the report

### Step 3: Prepare the Disclosure Report

**Goal**: Create a new, disclosure-ready technical report based on the vulnerability report and observations from the minimal PoC.

Create `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/report.md`. Do not modify the original report. The disclosure report must meet the following requirements:

1. **Verify all statements and claims**: Review every technical claim in the original report for accuracy and consistency. Correct any errors or inconsistencies.

2. **Update reproduction steps**: Ensure the "Steps to Reproduce" section references the minimal PoC files and includes exact commands to run them.

3. **Update observed results**: Replace any output from the original PoC with the authoritative output captured in Step 2. The "Observed Result" section must show what happens when running the minimal PoC.

4. **Remove internal identifiers**: Strip all internal audit identifiers (e.g., `C-01`, `H-02`), internal file paths, directory names, and any other references that are meaningful only within the audit context. The report must be standalone and self-explanatory to someone with no knowledge of the internal audit.

5. **Ensure completeness**: The report must include all of the following sections with appropriate detail:

#### Report Structure

#### Title

Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Heap Buffer Overflow in DHCP Option Parsing").

#### Summary

One-paragraph description of the vulnerability: what it is, where it occurs, and its impact.

#### Severity Assessment

- **CWE Classification**: CWE identifier and name (e.g., CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow).
- **CVSS Score**: CVSS v3.1 vector string, numeric score, and severity label with brief justification.

#### Pre-requisites

Detail any non-default compile-time or run-time configuration required to trigger the vulnerability. If the vulnerability triggers under default configuration, state that explicitly.

#### Security Impact

Describe the concrete security impact: what an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, privilege escalation) and under what conditions.

#### Root Cause

Annotate the relevant code snippets to trace how attacker-controlled data enters the vulnerable code path and leads to the security impact — and where validation is missing or insufficient. The analysis should be clear and concise, giving a security researcher or project maintainer enough insight to locate, verify, and fix the vulnerability.

#### Reproduction

##### Steps to Reproduce

Exact, step-by-step instructions with concrete commands to build the target, start the target, and run the PoC. Must be detailed enough for an independent party to reproduce the vulnerability given only this report and the artifacts in the disclosure directory.

##### Observed Result

Describe the expected evidence when following the reproduction steps — what output, crash, or behavior confirms the vulnerability. Include the actual output observed during reproduction (e.g., ASAN report, crash log, hex dump).

6. **Self-containment check**: A reader with only the report and the packaged artifacts should be able to fully understand and reproduce the vulnerability.

**Step 3 checkpoint** — before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] New disclosure report created at `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/report.md`
- [ ] Original report preserved unchanged
- [ ] All statements and claims verified for accuracy and consistency
- [ ] Observed results updated to reflect the minimal PoC output
- [ ] Reproduction steps reference the minimal PoC files
- [ ] All report sections present with appropriate detail
- [ ] No internal audit identifiers, paths, or IDs remain
- [ ] Report is self-contained and disclosure-ready

### Step 4: Write the Disclosure Email

**Goal**: Produce a ready-to-send plain-text email for reporting the vulnerability to the project maintainers.

Generate the email and store it in `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/email.txt`. The email is a high-level summary that communicates urgency and impact, referencing the attached `disclosure.zip` for full details.

**Format requirements**:

- Plain text only (no HTML or markdown formatting).
- First write the email without line wrapping, then use `fold -s -w 72` to wrap lines at word boundaries. Store the wrapped result as the final `email.txt`.

**Email structure**:

```
Subject: [Security] <concise description of the vulnerability>

Hi,

<Opening paragraph: state that you are reporting a security
vulnerability in [project name], and briefly describethe affected
component.>

<Affected versions paragraph: state which versions and modules are
known to be affected.>

<Impact paragraph: describe the security impact — what an attacker
could achieve, the severity (reference the CVSS score), and the
conditions required for exploitation. Focus on why the maintainer
should prioritize this.>

<Reproduction note: state that a detailed technical report with full
reproduction steps and a proof-of-concept is attached as
disclosure.zip. Mention the key evidence (e.g., "ASAN confirms a heap
buffer overflow").>

<Closing: offer to provide further details, coordinate on disclosure
timeline, and provide contact information.>

Regards,
<name / handle>
```

**Step 4 checkpoint** — before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] Email written to `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/email.txt`
- [ ] Plain-text format with lines wrapped at 72 characters
- [ ] Email communicates the security impact and references `disclosure.zip`
- [ ] No internal audit identifiers

### Step 5: Package Artifacts

**Goal**: Create a self-contained zip file with everything a maintainer needs.

Create `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/disclosure.zip` containing:

- The technical report (`report.md`)
- All minimal PoC files (scripts, configuration, crafted inputs)
- Any other artifacts that help the maintainer understand, reproduce, or fix the issue (e.g., harness source code, sample captures)

**Do not include**:

- The original development PoC or debug artifacts
- Internal audit identifiers in any file name or content
- The email (`email.txt`) — it is not part of the zip; it is the email body itself
- Unnecessary files that would burden the maintainer

**Step 5 checkpoint** — final verification:

- [ ] `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/disclosure.zip` created
- [ ] Zip contains the report and all minimal PoC files (plus any other helpful artifacts)
- [ ] Email in `__DISCLOSURE_DIR__/email.txt` is ready to send
- [ ] All artifacts are consistent — report observations match the minimal PoC output, email summary aligns with the report, no internal identifiers anywhere
